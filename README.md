## PROBLEMS CURRENTLY FACING
There are a lot of problems i am facing an would really like if anyone can help me out with it. Though am new to github but i'll
appreciate your review on this project.

### Search Section
One of my important problem is the search section, i want the search box to work properly, i.e user will be able to search
for any of the music they have on the software, this isn't functional yet

### Settings Page
The settings page is really a very huge task for me because under the themes section i don't  know how to go about it.
I already have the design outlook of different themes with photoshop but to make it effective on the software is tidious

The voice assistant panel is for the voice recognition engine added to the site but the issue is that section isn't really
effective because the voice reco doesn't really interact well it breaks sometimes and sometimes it works well. I can't 
say if it is a windows issue because its not from the code.

## Audio Panel
The audio panel consist of the following sub-pages
* Volume
* Listening
* Recording 
* Microphone

The volume tab is the section where you can reduce the volume or speaker settings of the software but this section 
is still on hold because i haven't figureed out how to go about it. Same goes to the listening and recording tabs also.
 **In the microphone tab you can enable voice recognition and try out some the special voice reco command such as 
 'Go to playlist', 'Go to Settings', 'Play', 'Next', 'Previous' and so on. The issue is when the voice reco is activated,
 the software tends to suddenly hide and it won't display any longer.

## Album page
I want to create an album page also for each music files and i also wanna be able to fetch the images attached to each music files
and also have a default pictures for music files without images attached. There are numerous popular artist image attached to the
software artist page. So that, users favourite artist image would be display above all the music tracks related to the artist.

### How to view the software
You can view the software either by going through this directory 'C:\Users\Dell\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Projects\Itone Media Player\Itone Media Player\bin\Debug\ItoneMediaApplication' click on the one with the icon.

Or better still just install the windows installer on your machine if you are a using windows although the installer is a little bit outdated because some changes have been made after the setup launch.
